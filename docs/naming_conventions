Project Naming Conventions

General Principles:
•	Naming Conventions: Use snake_case, with lowercase letters and understand ( _ ) to separate words.
•	Language: Use English for all names.
•	Avoid Reserved Words: Do not use SQL reserved words as object names.
Table Naming Conventions
	Bronze Rules:
•	All names must start with source system name, and table names must match their original names without renaming.
•	<sourcesystem>_<entity>
o	< sourcesystem>: Name of the source system (e.g., crm, erp).
o	<entity>: Exact table name from the source system.
o	Example: crm_customer_info  Customer information from the CRM system.
Silver Rules:
•	All names must start with source system name, and table names must match their original names without renaming.
•	<sourcesystem>_<entity>
o	< sourcesystem>: Name of the source system (e.g., crm, erp).
o	<entity>: Exact table name from the source system.
o	Example: crm_customer_info  Customer information from the CRM system.
Gold Rules:
•	All names must use meaningful, business-aligned names for tables, starting with the category prefix.
•	<category>_<entity>
o	< category>: Describes the role of the table, such as dim (dimension) or fact (fact table).
o	<entity>: Descriptive name of the table, aligned with the business domain (r.g., customer, products, sales).
o	Example:
	dim_customer  Dimension table for customer data.
	fact_sales  Fact table containing sales transactions. 
Glossary of Category Patterns
Pattern	Meaning	Example(s)
dim_	Dimension table	dim_customer, dim_product
fact_	Fact Table	fact_sales
agg_	Aggregated table	agg_customer, agg_sales_monthly

Column Naming Conventions
Surrogate Keys:
•	All primary keys in dimension tables must use the suffix _key.
•	<table_name>_key
o	<table_name>: Refers to the name of the table or entity the key belongs to.
o	 _key: A suffix indicating that this column is a surrogate key.
o	Example: customer_key  Surrogate key in the dim_customers table.
Technical Columns:
•	All technical columns must start with the prefix dwh_, followed by a descriptive name indicating 

Stored Procedure
•	All stored procedures used for loading data must follow the naming pattern: load_<layer>.
•	<layer> : Represents the layer being loaded, such as bronze, silver, or gold.
•	Example: 
o	load_bronze  Stored procedure for loading data into the Bronze layer.
o	load_silver  Stored procedure for loading data into the Silver layer.
